# DotsAndBoxesFSharp
Dots And Boxes Game Written in F#, C# &amp; WPF

This is a project so I can learn some F#, and improve my WPF while I am at it. It is a port of my  Haskell dots
and boxes game although I think I will go further with this as programmin in F# is a bit more fun (having access
to the whole of .NET an being able to 'cheat' with imperative code when I need it.)

It uses the Caliburn.Micro framework which I threw in because it is neat and because I will be using it at work
so this is some practicing.
